### Goal and Value of the Application
    The application is a bakery similar to the one we made in studio. The user will be able to add items to their cart and the total price
will be calculated for them. The user will also be able to filter through the items by their category and whether they are gluten free or not.
Finally, there is a sort feature, where it will sort all of the items by their price from low to high. All of these filters will work together 
if multiple are selected.
